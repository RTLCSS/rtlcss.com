# Why make a complete RTL version ?

Isn't it better to have a smaller RTL version containing only the set of flipped CSS rules ?

It might be, but it will not work in all situations! 

## Example

Assume we want to RTL the following document:

**HTML**
```html
<div>
    Title
    <img width="40" 
    src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Light_bulb_icon_tips.svg">
    <hr>
    <br>
      Contents Contents Contents 
      Contents Contents Contents 
      Contents Contents Contents 
      Contents Contents Contents 
      Contents Contents Contents 
      Contents Contents Contents 
</div>    
```

**CSS**
```css
hr {
 margin:10px;
}
img {
    float:right;
    clear:both;
}
div {
    border:solid 10px gray;
    width:200px;
    height:200px;
    padding:2px;
}
div hr {
    margin-right:40px;
}
```

Flipping the above using a subset of RTL overrides is straight forward:

**Override CSS**
```css
/*override*/
body {
    direction:rtl;
}
img {
    float:left;
}
div hr {
    margin-left:40px;   
}
```

As you may have noticed, the above solution does not address resetting the right margin value of the `hr` element! Which may lead to inconsistencies in your RTL version. 

You might say, why not to reset the `margin-right` declaration?

**Override CSS with RESET**
```css
div hr {
    margin-left:40px;   
    margin-right:0 /*or inherit*/;
}
```

Still inconsistent with the LTR version, as the value should be `10px` (cascaded by the `HR` CSS rule).

**Override CSS with fixed RESET**
```css
div hr {
    margin-left:40px;   
    margin-right:10px;
}
```

Which is an exact mirror of the original LTR version:

### Conclusion

Unless you can figure out the computed style, a subset of RTL overrides approach will fail.

***

### What about creating a combined CSS that prefixes rules with `html[dir="rtl"]`:

Unfortunately, this method is error-prone, as it messes with rules specificity.

Example CSS:
```css
body h1 {
  border-style:dashed dotted solid double;
  border-color:red green blue black;
  border-width: 1px 2px 3px 4px;
}
div h1 {
  border-color:green;
}
```

The combined version:
```css
body h1 {
  border-style: dashed dotted solid double;
  border-color: red green blue black;
  border-width: 1px 2px 3px 4px
}
div h1{
  border-color: green
}

html[dir="rtl"] body h1 {
  border-style: dashed double solid dotted;
  border-color: red black blue green;
  border-width: 1px 4px 3px 2px
}
```

In the LTR version `div h1` has higher specificity, but in the RTL version, the specificity of `html[dir="rtl"] body h1` will be higher ([JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/v57tubw3/)).


You might say, What about moving all the directional declarations into a separate rule ?

The same problem still exists!, let's make a slight change in the example CSS:

```css
body h1 {
    border-style: dashed dotted solid double;
    border-color: red green blue black;
    border-width: 1px 2px 3px 4px
}
body h1:not(:last-child) {
    border-color: green
}
```
Then combine it with separate rules:
```css
body h1:not(:last-child) {
    border-color: green
}
html[dir="ltr"] body h1 {
    border-style: dashed dotted solid double;
    border-color: red green blue black;
    border-width: 1px 2px 3px 4px
}
html[dir="rtl"] body h1 {
    border-style: dashed double solid dotted;
    border-color: red black blue green;
    border-width: 1px 4px 3px 2px
}
```

In the original CSS `body h1:not(:last-child)` has higher specificity and should render the **h1** with **green** border, But in the combined version,  the specificity of  `html[dir="ltr"] body h1` will be higher. ([JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/t60xkfgk/)).


### Conclusion

The solution would be to prefix all other rules with `html[dir]` maintaining their order, since for rules with same specificity, last one wins ([JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/MKY/vk4kydr4/)). 

For me I think having a separate file is better, as this will bloat your CSS file in terms of size, where changing the direction usually means a different language that will not need both LTR/RTL versions to be available at the same time.
