# Why Auto Rename ?

HTML documents developed for Right-to-Left languages such as Arabic, require setting  document direction to `rtl` , this will cause the browser to render its contents from right to left, which means markup elements will be rendered starting from the right side of the screen.

For example, let's say we want to render a fragment that look like this: `< content >`.

Using a UI framework such as [Semantic UI](http://www.semantic-ui.com), we'll be using the frameworks icons to represent the left and right angle brackets:

![ltr](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4712046/2056521/2f1a720e-8adf-11e3-9124-8483bb87fe5d.png)

[JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/EyHHJ/1)

As you can see, the `ui icon left angle` was rendered to the **left** of the content, and `ui icon right angle` icon rendered to the **right**.

But if we set the document direction to `rtl` - *keeping the markup intact* - the browser will render the `ui icon left angle` icon to the **right** of the content, and the `ui icon right angle` icon to the **left**:

Clearly, this is not the intended result! and for an RTL only page, the markup need to be reveresed, such as:

Great! But what about bilingual sites, Do we need to have separate markup to support both LTR & RTL languages ? 

The answer is **No!** We simply reverse the classes, making the [same markup](http://jsfiddle.net/QN4Nb/2) work for both. 


With  [auto rename](https://github.com/MohammadYounes/rtlcss#options-object) enabled, RTLCSS will automaticall rename any selector having directional keywords with no directional declarations, such as:
```CSS
i.icon.angle.left:before { content: "\f104"; }
i.icon.angle.right:before { content: "\f105"; }
```
Will be:
```CSS
i.icon.angle.right:before { content: "\f104"; }
i.icon.angle.left:before { content: "\f105"; }
```

The [auto rename](https://github.com/MohammadYounes/rtlcss#options-object) option is off by default. It can be enabled globally or at selector level using `/*rtl:rename*/` directive.
